# Java Upskilling Programme 2025

This repository contains solutions to challenges from the Java Upskilling Programme 2025. The programme is designed and facilitated by Narva College of the University of Tartu. Each lesson is organized in its respective directory (e.g., `lesson-01`, `lesson-02`, etc.). The `Main.java` file within each directory contains the core implementation along with comments covering key concepts from the lessons.

## How to Run the Code

The code can be run using [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download):

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition 2024.3.2.2 or later).
2. Click **File** â†’ **Open** and select the desired lesson folder (e.g., `lesson-01`).
3. Locate the `Main.java` file inside the folder.
4. Open `Main.java` and click the **Run** button (green play icon) at the top or right-click anywhere in the file and select **Run 'Main'**.

Java 21 is the version used throughout all lessons.
